## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Build Tooling (Phase 13-01):**
- Manual project structure creation (not using `create vite` CLI) - cleaner control over existing directory
- Simplified tsconfig without project references - avoids composite build complexity
- Path aliases configured upfront (@/core, @/components, @/*) - enables scalable imports

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Next Phase Readiness:**
- No blockers - build system foundation complete
- TypeScript strict mode ensures type safety for all future code
- Path aliases enable clean component/core architecture
