<objective>
Perform comprehensive manual testing of the application to verify all functionality works correctly after the maintainability overhaul.

Purpose: Automated tests cover critical business logic (tax, RMD, projections), but manual testing is required to verify UI workflows, browser compatibility, and end-to-end functionality. This ensures the refactoring didn't break user-facing features.

Output: Manual testing report documenting all tested features and any issues found.

  <action>
    Create a manual testing checklist document at .planning/phases/06-validation-polish/TESTING.md with:

    1. **Setup Instructions**:
       - How to open the application (open index.html in browser)
       - Browser versions tested (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
       - DevTools console monitoring

    2. **Core Functionality Tests**:
       - Create new plan
       - Add multiple account types
       - Add expenses with inflation
       - Add income sources
       - Run projections
       - Verify charts render
       - Save plan to localStorage
       - Load plan from localStorage
       - Export plan to JSON
       - Import plan from JSON
       - Toggle dark mode

    3. **Calculation Verification**:
       - Verify tax calculations match expected values
       - Verify RMD calculations trigger at correct age
       - Verify projection totals update when inputs change
       - Verify Monte Carlo simulation runs
       - Verify strategy rules (Backdoor Roth, QCD, etc.) apply correctly

    4. **UI/UX Tests**:
       - All forms validate input correctly
       - Error messages display appropriately
       - Modals open and close properly
       - Charts are responsive
       - Navigation works
       - Data persists across page refresh

    5. **Regression Tests** (issues from prior phases):
       - localStorage schema versioning works
       - No data loss on save/load
       - No console errors during normal operation
       - Charts display without errors

    Include checkboxes for each test item and space for notes/results.

    Manual testing instructions:

    1. Open the application:
       - Open index.html in Chrome/Firefox/Safari
       - Open DevTools console (Cmd+Option+I / F12)
       - Verify no console errors on load

    2. Test core workflow:
       - Click "Create New Plan"
       - Add 2-3 accounts (401k, IRA, Taxable) with balances
       - Add 2-3 expenses (housing, food, healthcare)
       - Add 1-2 income sources (salary, Social Security)
       - Click "Run Projections"
       - Verify charts appear with data
       - Click "Save Plan"
       - Refresh page (Cmd+R / F5)
       - Verify plan loads automatically

    3. Test data portability:
       - Click "Export Plan"
       - Save JSON file
       - Click "Create New Plan" (clear current)
       - Click "Import Plan"
       - Select the JSON file
       - Verify all data restored correctly

    4. Test UI features:
       - Click dark mode toggle
       - Verify colors change appropriately
       - Add/edit/delete accounts
       - Verify UI updates immediately
       - Try invalid inputs (negative numbers, text in number fields)
       - Verify validation errors appear

    5. Check for console errors:
       - Monitor console throughout testing
       - Note any errors or warnings
       - Report any red errors

    6. Mark each test in TESTING.md as PASS/FAIL with notes

    Expected result: All tests pass, no console errors, application works smoothly
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Document test results and create issue list</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/06-validation-polish/TESTING.md</files>
  <action>
    Based on the checkpoint results, update TESTING.md with:

    1. Test Results Summary:
       - Date tested
       - Browser(s) tested
       - Tests passed / failed
       - Overall status

    2. If issues found, create Issues section:
       - Issue #1: Description
         - Severity (critical/high/medium/low)
         - Steps to reproduce
         - Expected behavior
         - Actual behavior
         - Console errors (if any)

    3. If no issues found:
       - Note: "All manual tests passed successfully"
       - "Application ready for production use"

    4. Recommendations (if applicable):
       - Optional improvements discovered during testing
       - Edge cases to handle in future
       - UX enhancements

    Be thorough and honest about issues found. The goal is to validate the refactoring didn't break anything.
