  <files>.planning/phases/06-validation-polish/COMPLETION.md</files>
  <action>
    Create .planning/phases/06-validation-polish/COMPLETION.md with a comprehensive summary of the entire maintainability overhaul:

    1. **Executive Summary**:
       - Project duration
       - Total phases and plans completed
       - Overall achievement
       - Key metrics

    2. **Phase-by-Phase Summary**:
       - Phase 1: Quality Tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)
       - Phase 2: Tax Module Refactor (2,296 → focused modules)
       - Phase 3: UI Controller Refactor (1,347 → 4 controllers + coordinator)
       - Phase 4: Configuration Centralization (1,018+ magic numbers → config system)
       - Phase 5: Test Migration (custom runner → Vitest, coverage reporting)
       - Phase 6: Validation & Polish (ESLint fix, documentation, manual testing)

    3. **Key Achievements**:
       - Monolithic files split into focused modules
       - Hardcoded values centralized
       - Modern tooling established
       - Test coverage at 57%
       - All 308 tests passing
       - Zero ESLint errors
       - Documentation current

    4. **Metrics**:
       - Lines of code affected
       - Files created/modified
       - Test coverage before/after
       - Execution time
       - Plans completed per phase

    5. **Technical Decisions**:
       - Vitest over Jest
       - ESLint 9 flat config
       - ES6 modules maintained
       - Config accessor pattern
       - Controller extraction strategy

    6. **Lessons Learned**:
       - What worked well
       - What could be improved
       - Recommendations for future projects
       - Value of incremental refactoring

    7. **Future Opportunities** (optional):
       - Increase test coverage in storage and UI
       - Add TypeScript for type safety
       - Consider React migration for UI
       - Performance optimization
       - Security hardening

    8. **Conclusion**:
       - Maintainability overhaul successful
       - Codebase ready for long-term evolution
       - Foundation established for future enhancements

    Make this report comprehensive and celebratory - it documents a significant achievement in codebase improvement.
